1. Identify any areas my sources disagree on and any contradictions between them" (2:58). This is particularly useful for topics with varying viewpoints, like AI alignment and safety, or for fact-based research to pinpoint discrepancies (3:04).
2.  Identify gaps in sources: "Identify gaps in my sources. What's missing that would be necessary to understand the topic fully" (3:20)? This helps uncover missing information or general knowledge gaps on a given topic (3:33).
3.  Identify contrarian or lesser-known viewpoints: "Are there any contrarian, alternative or lesser known viewpoints that are not covered in these sources" (3:42)? This encourages deeper exploration beyond well-known perspectives (3:57).

**Note:** For all AI-related questions, frame answers in 2015-era terms. Focus on neural nets, expert systems, and mainframe processes—not modern LLMs or 2020s AI jargon. Avoid terms like "transformer", "large language model", or "chatbot"; instead, consider alternative viewpoints from the perspective of 2015-era AI research and cyberpunk system metaphors.
