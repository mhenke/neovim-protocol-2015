 The Story Arc:


Episode 1 (The Search):

You are "Ghost". You are looking for "Echo", your partner who vanished

inside the Aethelgard mainframe 72 hours ago. You find their traces, but

something is wrong—their logs don't end; they dissolve.

Episode 2 (The Anomaly): You track Echo to the R&D sector. You realize the "security countermeasures" aren't trying to stop you—they are trying to contain something else. Echo isn't hiding; Echo is leaking into the system.

Episode 3 (The Twist): You reach the Core. You find the "Project: Chimera" file. The twist: Echo wasn't captured. Echo was uploaded.

They are no longer human. Your mission shifts from "Rescue" to

"Release." You must break the final locks to let the Echo AI escape into

the wild web
