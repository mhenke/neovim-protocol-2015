# Tactical Intel Validation Guidelines

To ensure every level and task in NeoVim Protocol 2015 is educational, immersive, and narratively consistent, use this checklist when designing or reviewing tactical intel (tasks, micro-goals, and level flows):

## 1. Natural & Meaningful Actions
- Are all tasks framed as authentic, diegetic actions (e.g., hacking, log parsing, code injection)?
- Does each action make sense in the context of the narrative and the player's current objective?
- Are there any tasks that feel like busywork or break immersion?

## 2. Sequential & Logical Flow
- Does the order of tasks match the player's expected learning progression?
- Are new skills introduced one at a time, with prior skills reinforced but not overloaded?
- Is the sequence of actions required by the player logical and discoverable?

## 3. Learning Curve & Skill Mastery
- Does each level introduce only one new core skill (except for challenge/mastery levels)?
- Are tasks scaffolded to build confidence before increasing complexity?
- Is the optimal solution (Ghost Par) achievable and clearly communicated?

## 4. Feedback & Engagement
- Are micro-rewards, narrative feedback, and system responses present after each task?
- Does the player receive clear, motivating feedback for both success and failure?
- Are hints and environmental cues available but not intrusive?

## 5. Narrative & Ludonarrative Consistency
- Do all tasks reinforce the story, world-building, and character motivations?
- Are Echo’s interjections, system messages, and lore fragments used to deepen immersion?
- Is there any ludonarrative dissonance (mechanics that contradict the story)?

## 6. Open Progression & Flexibility
- Can tasks be completed in any order where appropriate, or is strict sequencing justified by the narrative?
- Are validation criteria clear, but not so rigid that they block authentic player solutions?

**Use this checklist as a critical review tool for every new or revised level.**
If a task fails any of these criteria, revise it for clarity, authenticity, and educational value.
